## Finding Locations
Students can search for classrooms, resource offices, food trucks, professor offices, and other relevant locations like “Beury Beach.”
After the student selects a location from the search options, the app places a marker on the map, and visually tracks the user’s current location through their phone’s GPS.

## Location Details
Each location will have a small area of text showing a classroom number, professor’s name, or other relevant info that the user searched for.
Each location, when tapped, will give the user a prompt to open a page with further information about the location.
This page will contain information such as alternate nicknames for the location, a paragraph with the general purpose of the building/area, and a few links to relevant Temple websites.

## Wiki functionality
Users may create an account that is linked to their email address. Their login information will be stored in an online database.
After a day of having a registered account on the app, users may begin editing location information--adding nicknames, editing the detail paragraph, or adding links to relevant websites.
Users may also add a location on campus through the app, providing relevant info along with placing the marker.
Since we expect our initial user base will be manageable, all changes to the wiki must be approved by an admin before going “live.”
Wiki information will be time stamped so the user can tell if the information might be out of date. For example, if Professor X’s room was SERC 305 5 years ago (last updated at that time), that would be displayed to the user with a warning that the information is particularly old.
