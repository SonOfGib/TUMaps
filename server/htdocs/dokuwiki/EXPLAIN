# Explanation #
This folder is a stub of the dokuwiki install folder, it contains the config files that were edited for our installation. This makes 
setting up the server easier, and protects the files in case any changes are made and need to be rolled back. The entire wiki has NOT been
added to version control because it uses a flat file storage system, and adding that to git would have been messy/unneccesary.
